    <h1>How to make Lovely Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Lasagna is italian, and much loved!</h2><br>
    <p>Lasagna is a broad, flat sheet of pasta. It’s most frequently layered with other ingredients, commonly but not exclusively a mixture of sauce, vegetables and some type of protein, and baked. Noodle variations include traditional types that are boiled then baked to finish cooking, and convenience variations that simply need to be put in the oven to cook. As the Daily Meal pointed out, it’s especially important to liberally sauce the no-boil variation of lasagna to avoid a too-dry dish. It’s also a point of emphasis for the traditional variety, although these noodles are somewhat more forgiving.</p>
